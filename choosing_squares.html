    <h1>Estimating the likelihood of unique shadings of a 10x10 grid</h1>
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    I taught the lesson today for 6th graders.
    It was about percentages.
    Percentage was introduced as "a fraction whose denominator is 100."
    We had a lot of time left after the lesson so I improvised in creating a problem.
    They had a few examples of filling in a 10x10 grid of sqaures as indicating percentage.
    For instance, 50/100 could be modeled as 50 of the squares being shaded.
    There are lots of ways you could choose 50 squares out of 100.
  </p>
  <p>
    I then asked them to fill 25 squares out of 100.
    With the added challenge that if any two students had the same model,
    then they would all lose the game.
    The challenge was that every single one of them should find a unique shading.
    I even added a time constrant of 2 minutes.
    There were 21 students.
  </p>
  <p>
    When everyone had chosen a shading, I had students come up to the front and
    I would show their shading to the rest of the class through the projector.
    The rest of the students in the class had to check their shading to see if it matched.
    It was an honors system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second student's shading was a checkers pattern.
    It turned out that another student had the same shadding.
    The game was already over!
  </p>
  <p>
    The	take away for that round was that the human brain doesn't choose uniformly at random.
    Especially under stress.
    The time constraint was the stressor.
    To ellaborate, the brain was to conserve energy.
    Trying to choose each of the 25 squares at random within 2 minutes is a high energy task.
    You're thinking about how little time remains.
    You're thinking about how non-random your last three choices were.
    You're having to keep tract of how many squares you've shaded in.
    Oops! Lost track again!
    You end up just filling in according to an easy pattern so you can just be done with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next I asked them to play the same game but choosing to shade in just 2 squares.
    They all filled them in much faster.
    I didn't hear any sounds of distress of choosing 2 squares in 2 minutes.
    Easy breezy lemon squeezy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we checked to see if they were all unique, I asked them if they thought it was more likely
    that at least two students had the same pattern with 25 or 2 squares shadded in?
    17 students voted for 25, 2 students voted for 2, and 2 students chose not to vote.
  </p>
  <p>
    This time all the models were the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's investigate whether or not the students had the write intuition about which number of squares was more likely
    to give at least 2 students having the same shading.
  </p>
  <p>
    But first a discussion about the limitations of the problem.
    To answer the problem about "students", we'd need to conduct exactly the same experiment with different
    sets of students. All of whom hadn't heard of this experiment before.
    This is called the Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) property of random variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we could run a computer simulation to answer the problem.
    Assuming each square is truely chosen uniformly at random.
    Here is that experiment.
    First a visualization of what the simulation is going.
    The visualization is slow.
    The simulation is very fast if we don't care to visualize it, but it's important to visualize to make sure we
    understand the process enough to code it up.
  </p>
